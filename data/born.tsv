He was the longest-serving and longest-lived Premier of Queensland , holding office from 1968 to 1987 , during which time the state underwent considerable economic development .

Bjelke-Petersen 's Country ( later National ) Party controlled Queensland despite consistently receiving the smallest number of votes out of the state 's leading three parties , achieving the result through a notorious system of electoral malapportionment that resulted in rural votes having a greater value than those cast in city electorates .

1688046	The African-American civil rights movement ( 1896–1954 ) was a long , primarily nonviolent series of events to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans . The era has had a lasting impact on United States society , in its tactics , the increased social and legal acceptance of civil rights , and in its exposure of the prevalence and cost of racism . Two United States Supreme Court decisions— '' Plessy v. Ferguson '' , which upheld `` separate but equal '' racial segregation as constitutional doctrine , and `` Brown v. Board of Education '' , which overturned `` Plessy '' —serve as milestones . This was an era of new beginnings , in which some movements , such as Marcus Garvey 's Universal Negro Improvement Association , were very successful but left little lasting legacy , while others , such as the NAACP 's painstaking legal assault on state-sponsored segregation , achieved modest results in its early years but made steady progress on voter rights and gradually built to a key victory in `` Brown v. Board of Education '' ( 1954 ) .	Brown; Ferguson	United States
